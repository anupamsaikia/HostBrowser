# HostBrowser
A non-FTP webhost Filemanager
#Introduction
This is a Filemanager specially designed for Webhosts. It doesn't rely on FTP. Instead it directly scans directories and files and show information about them.
It is easily browsable and secure.
#Installation
No installation required.
*Just place the HostBrowser.php file in a web accesible directory of your webhost (generally htdocs, www or public_html).
*After that visit the file from your browser http://www.example.com/path/to/HostBrowser.php. Obviously path/to/ is the location of the file.
*After that enter the password. Default password is "browse" (without quotes).
*Enjoy and be productive.
Note: Change the password immediately. You will have to edit the source.
  Find something like $conf['password'] and change the password there.
  You could have done this from HostBrowser itself!.
  
  
  Love you developers.
