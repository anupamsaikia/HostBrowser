# HostBrowser
A non-FTP webhost Filemanager
# Introduction
This is a Filemanager specially designed for Webhosts. It doesn't rely on FTP. Instead it directly scans directories and files and show information about them.
It is easily browsable and secure.
# Installation
No installation required.
* Just place the HostBrowser.php file in a web accesible directory of your webhost (generally htdocs, www or public_html).
* After that visit the file from your browser http://www.example.com/path/to/HostBrowser.php. Obviously path/to/ is the location of the file.
* After that enter the password. Default password is `hbx`
* The checkbox allows you to choose between a Basic and Advanced TextEditor _(Internet connection is required)_.
